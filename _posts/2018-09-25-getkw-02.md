This is part 1 of a series of posts on designing a general input parsing library.
By _general input parsing library_ we mean that the format of
the input is not fixed by the library itself. 

In this post, we will describe the data structure we will use for the input.

In the [first installment] in this series, we said:

> The structure of the input revolves around the concept of keywords and sections.

It is now time to give details.

## The data structure

We assume that the input is structured as a collection of **sections** and **keywords**. 
Keywords are 2-tuples (pairs) of a key and a corresponding value:
{% highlight python %}
class Keyword:
    def __init__(self, key, value):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
{% endhighlight %}
Anticlimactic eh? We could have used a tuple! Or a `namedtuple`! And I agree,
but this is our first attempt at implementing a data structure.

In first instance, sections are collections of keywords. Hence a dictionary
would suffice to represent them. The keys in the dictionary would be the the key of
the keyword, while the value would the keyword itself:
{% highlight python %}
class Section:
    def __init__(self, name, keywords={}):
        self.name = name
        self.keywords = keywords
{% endhighlight %}

**Question 0** Why not just collect keys and values in the section dictionary?
Because the keyword data type might be richer than just a simple 2-tuple. It
might contain units of measure, for example. Or type information.

However, we soon come up with the brilliant idea that sections might have subsections. And subsections, sub-subsections! _Ad libitum_!
So really the input is a sort of [multi-way (or _rose_) tree]. The root is a
section, with multiple sections as nodes and keywords as leaves. And so forth.

A possible implementation of section has a name, a dictionary of keywords, and a dictionary of sections:
{% highlight python %}
class Section:
    def __init__(self, name, keywords={}, sections={}):
        self.name = name
        self.keywords = keywords
        self.sections = sections
{% endhighlight %}

In addition, we want to serialize to a standard text format. We start with [JSON] since 
Python has a [standard library module] for it. For the moment we implement a
`toJSON` class method for both `Keyword` and `Section`, later we might decide to
do something fancier.
Thus bringing it all together:
{% highlight c++ %}
    {% include _snippets/getkw-data-structure.py %}
{% endhighlight %}
where we added a custom `__str__` method to the `Keyword` class.

## The data structure in action

For keywords:
{% highlight c++ %}
kw = Keyword('fuffa', 1)
print(kw)
dump_kw = kw.toJSON()
print('Dump a keyword\n{}\n'.format(dump_kw))

kw_vect = Keyword('mollo', [1, 2, 3])
print(kw_vect)
dump_kw_vect = kw_vect.toJSON()
{% endhighlight %}
which outputs:
{% highlight text %}
Key fuffa with value 1 and type <class 'int'>
Dump a keyword
{
    "key": "fuffa",
    "value": 1
}

Key mollo with value [1, 2, 3] and type <class 'list'>
Dump a section
{
    "name": "bar",
    "keywords": {
        "mollo": {
            "key": "mollo",
            "value": [
                1,
                2,
                3
            ]
        }
    },
    "sections": {}
}_vect.toJSON()
{% endhighlight %}

For sections:
{% highlight python %}
sect2 = Section('bar', {kw_vect.key : kw_vect}, {})
dump_sect2 = sect2.toJSON()
print('Dump a section\n{}\n'.format(dump_sect2))

sect1 = Section('foo', {kw.key : kw}, {sect2.name : sect2})
{% endhighlight %}
Note how `sect2` is a _subsection_ of `sect1` but does not have subsections itself.
The corresponding JSON for `sect2` looks as follows:
{% highlight text %}
Dump a section
{
    "name": "bar",
    "keywords": {
        "mollo": {
            "key": "mollo",
            "value": [
                1,
                2,
                3
            ]
        }
    },
    "sections": {}
}
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, the whole input is built simply as yet another section:
{% highlight python %}
inpt = Section('inpt', {kw.key : kw}, {sect1.name : sect1})

dumped = inpt.toJSON()
print('Dump whole input\n{}\n'.format(dumped))
{% endhighlight %}
and it JSON shows no particular suprises:
{% highlight text %}
Dump whole input
{
    "name": "inpt",
    "keywords": {
        "fuffa": {
            "key": "fuffa",
            "value": 1
        }
    },
    "sections": {
        "foo": {
            "name": "foo",
            "keywords": {
                "fuffa": {
                    "key": "fuffa",
                    "value": 1
                }
            },
            "sections": {
                "bar": {
                    "name": "bar",
                    "keywords": {
                        "mollo": {
                            "key": "mollo",
                            "value": [
                                1,
                                2,
                                3
                            ]
                        }
                    },
                    "sections": {}
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
